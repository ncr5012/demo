# Nick Rackley's Demo Repository

Welcome to the demo repository showcasing the software and hardware development skills of Nick Rackley. This repository contains selected projects that demonstrate my capabilities in developing sophisticated systems integrating both software and hardware components.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Reinforcement Learning Robot

**Project Overview:**
- An autonomously learning robot powered by a deep reinforcement learning agent.
- Continuously learns from passive human and environmental feedback, adapting its behavior to maximize positive human emotions and navigate its surroundings effectively.
- Designed and assembled all software and hardware components for this project.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Software:** Python, C++, Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in physical environments, Cloud Robotics, ROS2, Computer Vision for facial/emotional detection, Sensor Fusion, Sensor Firmware.
- **Hardware:** Circuit and power system design and assembly, LiPo battery integration, 3D chassis design and printing (Autodesk Fusion and 3D Printing), custom Mecanum wheel design and 3D printing, Brushless DC Motor and motor controller integration, integration of camera, ultrasonic distance sensor, speaker, and microphone.

**Video Demonstration:** [Watch here](https://youtu.be/BLXDSJCqv4M) - Demonstrates the robot operating in local mode, starting from scratch and learning about the world, akin to a newborn baby. At approximately 17:45, it begins to show emergent levels of intelligence and curiosity.

**Note:** Core IP files, including the core deep reinforcement learning loop and modified FogROS2 cloud deployment software, are omitted for proprietary reasons. Demos are available upon request. This project primarily showcases my proficiency in C++ and Python.

### 2. Financial Transformer

**Project Overview:**
- An innovative project aiming to predict the prices of over 70 stocks for the next day using an autoregressive transformer model, not unlike language models (LLMs).

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Software:** Python, design and training of transformer architecture from scratch, optimization of training loops for RAM and compute constraints.
- **Data Science:** Python, data structure creation, API utilization for data collection, data partitioning and cleaning, optimization of data structures and algorithms for RAM constraints.

### 3. RAG LLM

**Project Overview:**
- A class project involving a Retrieve and Generate (RAG) Language Model (LLM) system.
- Processes a PDF by chunking it, embedding the chunks, and using the embeddings to recommend relevant content for arbitrary queries through the OpenAI API, enhancing query responses beyond the base GPT 3.5 model capabilities.

**Development:** All projects were developed by Nick Rackley, showcasing a broad range of skills in software and hardware integration.
