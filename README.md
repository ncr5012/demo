# "The Ultimate Toy" robot project with no working name

This repository is to serve as a demonstration of Nick Rackley's full-stack robotics software development experience. Files include C++ firmware for cameras, ultrasonic sensors, motor controllers, speakers and Python computer vision software that detects faces, analyzes their emotions if a face is detected, and creates popup windows to debug the overall system. 

NOTE: Select files deemed core IP are omitted (the core deep reinforcement learning loop and heavily modified FogROS2 cloud deployment software). A demo could be performed on request. 


All relevant source code is in the "jaybot" folder. The /jaybot/src folder has the c++ firmware and /jaybot/scripts has the python reinforcment learning / facial detection software.
